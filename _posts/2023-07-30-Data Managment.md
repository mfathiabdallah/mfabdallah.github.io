A Data Management Plan (DMP) stats with specifying how research data will be handled, both **during and after** any research project. 

The goal of the DMP is to consider the many aspects of data management, metadata generation, data preservation, and analysis before the project begins.

Therefore, it identifies key actions and strategies to ensure that research data are of a high-quality, secure, sustainable, and – to the extent possible – accessible and reusable.

 In this regards, I will give a breif introduction about DMP for the selected students in the Advanced Lab 10 - <a href="https://egyptscholars.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Egypt Scholars Orgnization </a></p> under the theme (Towards Mitigating the Climate Change Crsis).
