## Membership

I am thrilled to share my recent Global Food Regulatory Science Society (GFoRSS) membership!

GFoRSS is a not-for-profit organization incorporated in Canada and hosted by the Food Risk Analysis and Regulatory Excellence Platform (PARERA), a joint endeavor of the Department of Food Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture and Food Sciences and the Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods (INAF) of the Universit√© Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada. GFoRSS aims to promote the generation and dissemination of knowledge and competencies related to food regulatory sciences, that is, the sciences underpinning food regulatory decisions as a multi-disciplinary field of food science, including, but not limited to, the application of food risk analysis and associated disciplines, the development of food laws and the assessment of economic impacts of food regulatory measures.
